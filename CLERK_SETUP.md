## ðŸŽ‰ Current Status: WORKING IN DEMO MODE

The Marshild application is now running successfully at **http://localhost:3000** in demo mode!

- Global state management and caching
- Demo user data (Demo User - demo@marshild.com)
- All analysis features with mock data

## ðŸ”§ Optional: Set Up Clerk Authentication

If you want to add real user authentication, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Create a Clerk Account
1. Go to [https://dashboard.clerk.com/](https://dashboard.clerk.com/)
2. Sign up for a free account
3. Create a new application

### Step 2: Get Your API Keys
1. In your Clerk dashboard, go to **API Keys** section
2. Copy the **Publishable Key** (starts with `pk_test_`)
3. Copy the **Secret Key** (starts with `sk_test_`)

### Step 3: Update Environment Variables
1. Open the `.env.local` file in the project root
2. Replace the placeholder values:
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_your_actual_publishable_key_here
   CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_your_actual_secret_key_here
   ```

### Step 4: Configure Clerk Application
In your Clerk dashboard, set up the following URLs:
- **Home URL**: `http://localhost:3000`
- **Sign-in URL**: `http://localhost:3000/sign-in`
- **Sign-up URL**: `http://localhost:3000/sign-up`
- **After sign-in URL**: `http://localhost:3000/dashboard`
- **After sign-up URL**: `http://localhost:3000/dashboard`

### Step 5: Restart the Application
```bash
npm run dev
```
